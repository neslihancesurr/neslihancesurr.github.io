I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence in [the department of Computer Engineering](https://www.ozyegin.edu.tr/en/computer-science) at Özyeğin University where I focus on how languages can be modeled and analyzed computationally. My main interests lie in the representation of lexical information, morphology, syntax, argument structure, and semantic roles. I’m particularly passionate about applying machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) to train models capable of automatically analyzing linguistic data.

Before my current studies, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Comparative Linguistics and French Literature from [Galatasaray University](https://gsu.edu.tr/tr) and an M.A. in Linguistics from [Boğaziçi University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/), where my research centered on linguistic typology and morphosyntax. For my master's thesis, I investigated negation in Pazar Laz, a low-resource minority language spoken in northeastern Turkey.

My thesis <em>Negation in Pazar Laz<em> can be accessed [here]().
